# Excel Optimizer: Spreadsheet Reader and Organizer

## Project Description

"Excel Optimizer" is a Python-based project designed to optimize the reading and querying of Excel files. The code allows users to list data in various ways, such as only those who have paid, in alphabetical order, in the order the data is in the file, or sorted according to the date field. This project was created to solve visibility problems and speed up the process of querying spreadsheets with large amounts of records and columns. In addition, it was an opportunity to learn more about the Python language and apply data structure techniques for sorting different types.
